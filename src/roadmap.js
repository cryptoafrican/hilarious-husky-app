While Hilarious Huskies is starting out as an NFT project, the goal is to make this a lifestyle brand, focusing on dog (and really all animal) lovers. 
</p>
<p class="text-xl">
NFT projects can be about a lot of things. For us, it's about building a community of likeminded people. Yes, we love the art and we love the code, but our primary objective is going to be creating an environment for the community to thrive… and have some fun along the way. 
</p><p class="text-xl">
Art projects shouldn’t need to have a roadmap, but in today’s NFT environment – with all the rug pulls, low effort art, scams, copycat projects and just general shitiness, we need to stand out and give our holders value over and above what is essentially a cute pfp. 
We want to hit 100% of what we set out to do, so we will be calling on the community to vote on what we do first. One token, one vote.
</p>
<strong>Phase One 2021</strong>
<li>Deliver 3000 new-born pups to their new owners</li>
<li>Launch Husky Chat - a messaging tool that will allow HUSK holders to speak with and engage other holders directly through the Hilarious Huskies web app. </li>
<li>Jackpot – 16% of all total sales from the mint will be set aside for the jackpot which could potentially be valued at around 12 ETH. Four winners will be announced after the initial mint.</li>
<li>Listings with Rarity.tools and Rarity Sniper</li>
<br/>
<strong>Phase Two 2022+</strong>
<li>Merch: Verified holders can purchase Hilarious Husky apparel with their Hilarious Huskies printed on them</li>
<li>Burn mechanism: holders will be able to breed a new husky by burning two husky tokens</li>
<li>Development and release of HH DAO with $HUSKY token airdropped to all hodlers proportionally</li>
<li>Live Events in your city</li>
