    <Accordion.Header>Why</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>    
    We wanted to do this because weâ€™re Husky lovers. The project started out as a programatic pixel art project, but has since expanded as we added some blue sky to our thinking. As part of the first phase, we will be dropping 3000 Hilarious Husky ERC721 tokens with a number of different traits. Rarity will be announced after minting. As a part of phase two, we will have the community decide what the project team will do next. Don't forget to join the discord!

    <Accordion.Body>
    While some were minted in September for giveaways and for the project team, a few others got lucky and minted because I definitely forgot to flip the mint swtich at launch. lol. 
    These can be minted at the drop by either use this site (click on mint) or you can also interact with the contract on etherscan yourself. 
    Verified contract &amp; code is available <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x6e918a90dcb258353acca3dfdb2a54a5d81c4596#code"><u>here</u></a>.
