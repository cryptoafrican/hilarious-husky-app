    <Accordion.Header>Why</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>    
    We wanted to do this because weâ€™re Husky lovers. 
    The project started out as a programatic pixel art project, but since then we've added some blue sky to our thinking. 
   As part of the first phase, we will be dropping 3000 Hilarious Husky ERC721 tokens with a number of different traits. Rarity will be
   announced after we mint out. As part of phase two, we will let the community decide what the project team will do next. Dont forget to join the discord.

    <Accordion.Header>How can I mint one?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
    Some were minted in September for giveaways and for the project team. Some got lucky and minted a few cause I dev forgot to flip the mint swtich at launch. lol.
    You can mint them at the drop. You can either use this site (click on mint) or you can interact with the contract on etherscan yourself. 
    Verified contract &amp; code is available <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x6e918a90dcb258353acca3dfdb2a54a5d81c4596#code"><u>here</u></a>. 
    Shoot us an email or get in touch with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/HuskiesNft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter</a> or on the <a href="https://discord.gg/bYCs6UMWDS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord </a>if you have any trouble.

    Husky metadata and pngs are stored on the IPFS and will be preserved for eternity. A cached version is also avaialbe on AWS (IPFS is a bit slow at times).
